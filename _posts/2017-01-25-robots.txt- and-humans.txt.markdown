Robots.txt is a file you save with your project and when a search engine looks for things and find your
project it first checks this file and depending on what you have configured the search engine (robot) have different access to the project.
I have decided to not allow any robots on my site.

Humans.txt is a file where you keep all the persons that have worked on the project documented. 
So that if anyone wants to see who is supposed to be credited for the site they check in this file.

Both of these files I have put in my SRC folder.
