Open Graph is a way of easy sharing on social media like Facebook and Instagram etc.
I have used Opengraph and put the information as metatags in my layouts so that every blogpost easily can be shared on social media.
Open graph is good to use for example when you want to expand the reader base of your blog, if it is easy to share more people will share 
with friends when they like something you write.
