Static site generators are really good since they are alot faster and more secure then dynamic websites.
The big difference between them is that a dynamic site donÂ´t do anything until a request is made and then it does all the calls needed,
while a static site updates frequently as fast as anything is changed so that when a request is made the site just puts this in a nice format and returns it.
This leads to that a static site has alot less server activity and therefore is faster etc.

I would say that static site generators are best suited for projects where there are alot of readers,
but not much interaction with the user such as log in etc that require connection and requests and responses from servers for each user.
