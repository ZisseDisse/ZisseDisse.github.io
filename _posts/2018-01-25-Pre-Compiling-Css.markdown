1. regular CSS VS Sass
With pre-compiler I have alot of more functionality in my Css since I can save colors, sizes etc. in different variables.

2. Which teqniques did you use ?
Since i had alot of technical problems and are doing this after the course is done i do not have alot of extra time to spend on this, 
I there for have only used Minima and made my own changes within the layout such as changed colors and added/removed things i wanted/ not wanted.

3. Pros & Cons
Makes coding faster and easier to maintain the code since I dont need to repeat my self. 
The pros are several more like I get a more structured code but cons in this case is also that the code is harder to read for someone not used to pre-compiler.
The old way of writing Css is really clear to pretty much anyone and pre-copmiler is really clear if you know how javascript works otherwise it is really hard to understand how it works and what is what.
