My name is Martina and I am 24 years old, studiyng UDM at LNU.
I live in a small town in the north called Boden and i really like it here after growing up in gothenburg. The calmnes and the beautiful nature gives so much energy.
Right now my partner and I plus our son lives in a terraced house but dreams about buying a big house with alot of garden.
So what do i do on my spare time ?
I have way to little spare time since my son is only 16months and I am studiyng full time with him only half time in kindergarden. 
But the spare time I do have i like to sew cloths and other things for both me and my son. I also grow alot of food in my grandmothers garden since they have a house with more room for gardening,
then we have. 

As soon as i have some extra time i also want to learn more about creating websites etc.
